one of the regex patterns we use in the code is called VARIABLE_DECLARATION_PATTERN
"^\\s*(?:(final)\\s+)?(int|double|String|boolean|char\\b(?:[a-zA-Z]\\w*|_[a-zA-Z0-9]\\w*)\\b)|\\b(?:[a-zA-Z]\\w*|
_[a-zA-Z0-9]\\w*)\\b))*)\\s*;\\s*$"
the pattern validates the whole structure of a variable declaration
to break it down:
Group 1 captures whether the variable is final or not (captures final if it is, null if not)
Group 2 captures the variable's type
Group 3 captures the content of the variables' definitions - later to be validated
^ - start of the string
\s* - optional whitespace
(final)\s+ - final keyword
(int|double|String|boolean|char)\b - type of the variable
\b(?:[a-zA-Z]\w*|_[a-zA-Z0-9]\w*)\b - name of the variable
  This has two alternatives:
[a-zA-Z]\w* - starts with a letter, followed by zero or more word characters (letters, digits, underscores)
_[a-zA-Z0-9]\w* - starts with an underscore, followed by at least one alphanumeric character, then zero or more word characters
\s*; - semicolon
\s*$ - end of the string

the second regex pattern we use is called METHOD_PATTERN
"^\\s*void\\s+(\\b[a-zA-Z]\\w*\\b)\\s*\\(([^)]*)\\)\\s*\\{"
the pattern validates the whole structure of a method declaration
to break it down:
Group 1 captures the method's return type (void)
Group 2 captures the method's name
Group 3 captures the method's parameters
^ - start of the string
\s*void\s+ - void keyword
(\b[a-zA-Z]\w*\b) - name of the method
\s*\(([^)]*)\) - opening parenthesis, followed by the method's parameters, followed by closing parenthesis
\s*\{ - opening curly bracket}

we have more patterns for if\while\comment lines.

the structure of out code is as follows:
Scope - this is the class responsible for holding all the variables and methods,
it uses the LineReader class to classify the lines as comments, variables, methods, etc.
then act accordingly, throw an exception or add the variable\method to the Scope, etc.
LineReader - this class reads the file line by line and classifies it as a comment, variable, method, etc.
Variable - this class represents a variable, it has a name, type, and value
Method - this class represents a method, it has a name, parameters, and body and self validating methods.
IfWhile - this class represents an if\while statement, it has a condition and a body and self validating methods.
Utils - utils varies from class to class, some classes have more self validating methods in the utils.
some have extract methods to get the variable\method name\type\body\condition to be used in other classes for validation.
reg_ex_patterns - this class holds all the regex patterns we use in the code.
Main - specifically SJava, this is the main class, it reads the file and calls the Scope class to validate it.
the main (not the Sjava class) is also where we keep the type 2 exceptions.
